# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: TechTrends - Package with Docker

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch -> main branch 
on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
